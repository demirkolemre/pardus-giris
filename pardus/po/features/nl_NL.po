"Ubuntu MATE is a modern computer operating system, with an attractive and "
"easy to understand user interface. Its update manager keeps not only the "
"operating system itself, but all of its installed applications updated to "
"the current release. The operating system is more secure, and better "
"supported than operating systems that come pre-installed on most home "
"computer hardware today."
msgstr "Ubuntu MATE is een modern besturingssysteem, met een aantrekkelijke en gemakkelijk te begrijpen gebruikersomgeving. Zijn update manager houdt niet alleen het besturingssysteem zelf courant, maar ook alle geïnstalleerde applicaties. Het besturingssysteem is veiliger en wordt beter ondersteund dan besturingssystemen die typisch vooraf geïnstalleerd worden op de meeste hedendaagse computers."

"Ubuntu MATE is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems that"
" update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously. The "
"updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and all of its components. "
"Security updates for all of its installed applications are also provided on "
"the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all "
"of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!"

"Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections... but it doesn't. Rapid "
"and timely updates ensure that there are very few, if any threats to Linux "
"systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality, there have "
"been very few \"public\" infections in the last 10 years that can affect "
"Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone installing or using a "
"modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it "
"difficult for viruses, root kits and other malware to be installed and run "
"without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally"
" invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and "
"won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu MATE."

"Another significant security feature of Ubuntu MATE is that its users are "
"not administrators by default. Administrators (\"root\" users) on any "

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu MATE opens"
" a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu MATE will recognize the file as a program. The system"
" provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a "
"program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra "
"secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."
